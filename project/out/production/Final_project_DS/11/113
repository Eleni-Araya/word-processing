Transcendental consciousness is subtler than waking state consciousness because it goes beyond ordinary waking experiences. Transcendental consciousness is a state of awareness that transcends the boundaries of the self and taps into a deeper level of consciousness, characterized by unity, connectedness, and expanded awareness. It represents a subtler, more expansive dimension of human consciousness.
