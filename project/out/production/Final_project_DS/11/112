Example A is Times New Roman, size ten, with single spacing. Example B is Arial, size twelve with 1.5 spacing. As you can see, smaller font sizes, single spacing and serif fonts are harder to read. Additionally, it is easier to keep oneâ€™s place on a page with left aligned text, as in example B, as left alignment gives the body of the text a specific shape and gives uniformity between words. Example A, which is justified, has no natural shape. Furthermore, bold print stands out, and does not distort the shape of text as italics and underlining do. Finally, block capitals can be difficult to follow as block capitals remove the natural shape of words, turning them into blocks. Clear layout allows one to focus on the content of visual materials rather than the format.
